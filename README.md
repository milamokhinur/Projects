Data Analysis Projects 
In my recent data analysis project focused on future bike sales, I meticulously transformed raw data into a streamlined and analytically rich format using Excel features. Employing techniques such as eliminating duplicate entries, replacing abbreviations with full terms (e.g., M to Male, M to Married), and addressing missing values. Additionally, I implemented the IF formula to create a new age group column, enhancing the interpretability of age-related insights.

The core of the project involved the creation of insightful pivot tables, forming the foundation for a comprehensive bike sales dashboard. Leveraging Excel's capabilities, I examined each column to validate data integrity, assuring the absence of null values. The resulting dashboard provides a nuanced perspective on key factors influencing bike sales.

The Bike Sales Dashboard represents critical information, notably presenting the average income disparities between male and female customers who either make a purchase or abstain. This insight serves as a valuable guide for determining the approximate target income for effective bike sales strategies. Furthermore, the dashboard sheds light on the age distribution of bike customers, showing that middle-aged individuals are more inclined towards making a purchase.

Another pivotal aspect of the analysis is the exploration of commute distances among bike buyers, offering a crucial understanding of consumer behavior. The inclusion of a slicer feature of Excel enhances the dashboard's versatility, allowing for dynamic filtering based on region, education, and marital status..

In sum, my data analysis project showcases my skills in utilizing Excel for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. The resulting dashboard not only presents a coherent narrative of the bike sales landscape but also highlights some of my skills in deriving actionable insights from complex datasets.
